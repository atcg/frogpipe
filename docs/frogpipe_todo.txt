Frogpipe To Do:

-Optimize the optimizer function for... velvet optimizer
    -or just give up around 30k
-Get coverage stats working
-Look at LASTZ in place of blast: http://www.bx.psu.edu/miller_lab/dist/README.lastz-1.02.00/README.lastz-1.02.00a.html
-Look at brant's pipeline
-Fix adapter files for 3' contamination control
-Write shell script to run all samples (fastq pairs) in a folder--move results to data drives before running new analysis

-Demultiplex the large unassigned dataset?

-Rename all the velvet files and records:
    -Sample name should be in the filename (instead of contigs.fa)
    -deflines of contigs should start with sampleID___ or something else that is easy to find w/ regex
    
-Implement GATK for calling SNPs
